# my-cardio-app
MyCardioApp is an Android database app for touch-screen mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.). MyCardioApp records health-related data such as blood pressure readings, exercise sessions, and alcohol consumption.

We created this app to accompany our Android Database Apps book. Our book discusses the creation of a production-level Android database app from concept to first release. We use theory and practice to demonstrate computer science principles and technologies required for developing an Android app underpinned by a relational database.

Our book is not a collection of disparate tutorials. Nor is it a code recipe book. Although our book shows how to plan, create, and develop an app for a specific purpose, we use concepts and strategies that apply to general Android applications and beyond.

There are three parts:

- Planning.

- Infrastructure.

- Implementation.

General software design patterns are the same for many different environments.
